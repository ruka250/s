/**
 This shared test case class is intended to provide commonly mocked objects and methods for stubbing out common side effects such as
 fetching from the network when objects are missing from a given cache. Additionally this class will handle stopping mocking and invalidating
 mock objects to avoid potential shared global state between tests.

 In general there are three broad use cases for mocks. These include:

 1) stubbing out a method in order to avoid calling it or to provide a known return value.

 2) stubbing out a method (usually an initializer or a singleton) to replace an object with a test object.

 3) stubbing out a method on the object you're testing. ie. use the real implementation for method a but stub out the implementation for method b.

 4) verifying behavior - something was called or something was not called etc...

Before you write a new class mock. Check to see if there's already an implementation in this class.
Also, to get a better understanding of mocking, please read the documentation at https://ocmock.org/
